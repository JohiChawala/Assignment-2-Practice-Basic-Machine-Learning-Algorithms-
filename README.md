# Assignment 2 (Practice Basic Machine Learning Algorithms)

# use Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

This assignment is based on Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset available with this assignment. It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

Number of times pregnant.
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
Diabetes pedigree function.
Age (years).
Class variable (0 or 1).
Your tasks are summarized below, 

load the dataset and assign columns proper names as mentioned above
preprocess dataset to normalize all the values 
split data in 70-30 train and test sets
apply five machine learning algorithms (LDA, Naïve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)  and summarize the performance on test sets (display confusion matrix, report accuracy and also display classification report)
Which algorithm performs best? 
Down sample the data to balance it
repeat 4-5 on down sampled dataset to report the effect of down sampling.
