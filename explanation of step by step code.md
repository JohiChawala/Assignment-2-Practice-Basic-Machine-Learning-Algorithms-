# Step 1: Load the Dataset and Assign Proper Column Names

## import pandas as pd

The line import pandas as pd is telling Python to bring in the Pandas library and give it a shorter nickname or alias, which is pd. This makes it easier to refer to Pandas functions and objects in your code. Instead of typing out pandas each time, you can use the shorter and more convenient pd. It's a common practice in the Python data science community to use pd as the alias for Pandas.

## url = "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/pima-indians-diabetes.csv"
## column_names = ["Pregnancies", "Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI", "DiabetesPedigreeFunction", "Age", "Outcome"]
## data = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names)

- url = "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/pima-indians-diabetes.csv": This line creates a variable named url and assigns it the path to a CSV file. It looks like the file is located in a Google Drive folder at "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/".

- column_names = ["Pregnancies", "Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI", "DiabetesPedigreeFunction", "Age", "Outcome"]: This line creates a list named column_names containing the names of the columns you want to assign to your DataFrame. Each element in the list corresponds to a column in the CSV file.

- data = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names): This line uses the Pandas read_csv function to read the CSV file specified by the url variable. It assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable data. The names parameter is used to specify the names of the columns for the DataFrame.

# Step 2: Preprocess the Dataset to Normalize Values

## from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

- <b>sklearn:</b> This is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides various tools for data mining and data analysis.

- <b>preprocessing:</b> Within scikit-learn, the preprocessing module contains functions and classes for data preprocessing tasks, such as scaling, encoding, and imputation.

- <b>StandardScaler:</b> StandardScaler is a class used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. In other words, it transforms your data in such a way that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


## X = data.drop("Outcome", axis=1)

This line creates a new DataFrame X by dropping the column named "Outcome" from the original DataFrame data. This is typically done to separate the features (independent variables) from the target variable.

## y = data["Outcome"]

This line creates a Series y containing the values of the column named "Outcome" from the original DataFrame data. This is your target variable, and you're separating it from the features

## scaler = StandardScaler()

This line creates an instance of the StandardScaler class from scikit-learn. You've already imported StandardScaler at the beginning.

## X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

This line uses the fit_transform method of the StandardScaler to standardize (normalize) the feature matrix X. It first fits the scaler to the data (calculates the mean and standard deviation) using the fit method and then transforms (standardizes) the data using the transform method.

## In simpler terms, these lines of code are preparing your data for machine learning:

- X contains the features (independent variables) after removing the target variable.
- y contains the target variable.
- X_normalized contains the standardized (normalized) version of the features using StandardScaler. Standardization is done to ensure that all features have the same scale, which can be important for certain machine learning algorithms.

# Data Visualization using pairplot of the Dataset

- <b>import seaborn as sns:</b> Imports the Seaborn library, which is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. Seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics.

- <b>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt:</b> Imports the Matplotlib library's pyplot module, which is commonly used for creating visualizations in Python.

- <b>sns.pairplot(data, hue="Outcome", diag_kind="kde"):</b> Creates a pairplot of the DataFrame data. A pairplot is a grid of scatterplots for each pair of features in the dataset. The hue parameter is set to "Outcome," indicating that the color of the points will be based on the values in the "Outcome" column. The diag_kind parameter is set to "kde," which means that the diagonal will show kernel density estimates.

- <b>plt.suptitle("Pairplot of the Dataset"):</b> Adds a title to the entire pairplot. The suptitle function is used to set the super title (the title above all subplots).

- <b>plt.show():</b> Displays the pairplot.

# Step 3: Split Data into Train and Test Sets

## from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

This line imports the train_test_split function from the model_selection module in scikit-learn. This function is commonly used for splitting datasets into training and testing sets.

## X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_normalized, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

- <b>X_normalized:</b> This is the feature matrix that you previously standardized using StandardScaler. It contains the independent variables (features) of your dataset.

- <b>y:</b> This is the target variable that you separated earlier. It contains the dependent variable (the variable you are trying to predict).

- <b>test_size=0.3:</b> This parameter specifies the proportion of the dataset that should be used for testing. Here, it's set to 0.3, meaning 30% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 70% will be used for training.

- <b>random_state=42:</b> This parameter sets the random seed for reproducibility. It ensures that if you run the code multiple times, you'll get the same split. The choice of 42 is arbitrary; you could use any integer.

### After executing this code, you'll have four sets of data:

- <b>X_train:</b> The feature matrix for the training set.
- <b>X_test:</b> The feature matrix for the testing set.
- <b>y_train:</b> The target variable for the training set.
- <b>y_test:</b> The target variable for the testing set.
