# Step 1: Load the Dataset and Assign Proper Column Names

## import pandas as pd

The line import pandas as pd is telling Python to bring in the Pandas library and give it a shorter nickname or alias, which is pd. This makes it easier to refer to Pandas functions and objects in your code. Instead of typing out pandas each time, you can use the shorter and more convenient pd. It's a common practice in the Python data science community to use pd as the alias for Pandas.

## url = "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/pima-indians-diabetes.csv"
## column_names = ["Pregnancies", "Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI", "DiabetesPedigreeFunction", "Age", "Outcome"]
## data = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names)

- url = "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/pima-indians-diabetes.csv": This line creates a variable named url and assigns it the path to a CSV file. It looks like the file is located in a Google Drive folder at "/content/drive/My Drive/DataScience/Assignment_no_2/".

- column_names = ["Pregnancies", "Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI", "DiabetesPedigreeFunction", "Age", "Outcome"]: This line creates a list named column_names containing the names of the columns you want to assign to your DataFrame. Each element in the list corresponds to a column in the CSV file.

- data = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names): This line uses the Pandas read_csv function to read the CSV file specified by the url variable. It assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable data. The names parameter is used to specify the names of the columns for the DataFrame.

# Step 2: Preprocess the Dataset to Normalize Values

## from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

- <b>sklearn:</b> This is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides various tools for data mining and data analysis.

- <b>preprocessing:</b> Within scikit-learn, the preprocessing module contains functions and classes for data preprocessing tasks, such as scaling, encoding, and imputation.

- <b>StandardScaler:</b> StandardScaler is a class used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. In other words, it transforms your data in such a way that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
